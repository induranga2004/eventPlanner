## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes Made:**

1. **Added Event-Specific Name Mapping:**
```python
EVENT_CONCEPT_NAMES = {
    "wedding": {
        "A1": "Grand Wedding Luxury",
        "A2": "Garden Wedding Romance", 
        # ... etc
    },
    "birthday": {
        "A1": "Birthday Celebration Deluxe",
        # ... etc
    }
    # ... all event types
}
```

2. **Updated Title Generation Function:**
```python
def pick_title(concept_id: str, event_type: str = "default") -> str:
    event_type = event_type.lower() if event_type else "default"
    event_names = EVENT_CONCEPT_NAMES.get(event_type, EVENT_CONCEPT_NAMES["default"])
    return event_names.get(concept_id, fallback_title)
```

3. **Enhanced API Integration:**
- Updated `routers/planner.py` to pass event type to title generation
- Modified concept details function to use dynamic titles
- Expanded supported event types in the API schema
