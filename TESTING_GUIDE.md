## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: FAB button doesn't appear
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify provider selection confirmed
- Check if `window.showPosterCTA` function exists
- Ensure modal closed successfully

### Issue: Event context not loading in wizard
**Solution**:
- Check localStorage has `eventPlanningContext` key
- Verify backend API responds to GET request
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure EventPlanningProvider wraps app in main.jsx

### Issue: Smart query is generic
**Solution**:
- Verify musicians have `genres` array populated
- Check venue string includes city name
- Ensure cost distribution calculated
- Review `generateSmartQuery` function logic

### Issue: Backgrounds don't reflect event style
**Solution**:
- Check if genres extracted correctly (DevTools console)
- Verify `event_aware_prompts.py` receiving event context
- Review OpenAI prompt in backend logs
- Try regenerating with different query

### Issue: Musicians not appearing in final poster
**Solution**:
- Verify musician providers have `photo` field populated
- Check if photo URLs accessible
- Review backend logs for rembg errors
- Ensure harmonization received musician_image_urls array

### Issue: Download fails
**Solution**:
- Check if image URLs valid (paste in browser)
- Verify CORS allows image download
- Try right-click ‚Üí Save Image As
- Check browser download permissions
