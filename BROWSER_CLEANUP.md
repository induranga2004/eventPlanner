# Browser Storage Cleanup Instructions

If you're still seeing all users as Pro after the database fix, please clear your browser storage:

## Method 1: Clear localStorage (Recommended)
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find "Local Storage" â†’ "http://localhost:5174"
4. Delete the "token" entry
5. Refresh the page and log in again

## Method 2: Hard Refresh
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. This clears browser cache and forces reload

## Method 3: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5174
3. Login with a test account

## Expected Behavior After Fix:
- Free users (123@gmail.com, abc@gmail.com, etc.): Should see standard dashboard with "Upgrade to Pro" button
- Pro user (111@gmail.com): Should see Pro dashboard with gold badge and premium features

## Test Accounts:
- Free: 123@gmail.com (password: 123)
- Pro: 111@gmail.com (password: 111)

The database has been fixed and all users now have proper subscription status fields.
